# Movie Recommendation System

This project is a Movie Recommendation System primarily built using Jupyter Notebooks and Python. The system leverages data science and machine learning to provide personalized movie suggestions to users based on their preferences and historical data.

## How the Model Works

Our recommendation engine uses a combination of content-based and collaborative filtering techniques, implemented and evaluated in interactive Jupyter Notebooks.

### 1. Data Preprocessing

- **Loading Data:** The system uses a movie dataset (such as MovieLens or a similar public dataset) containing movie details, user ratings, and additional metadata.
- **Cleaning:** Missing values are handled, and relevant features are extracted to prepare the data for modeling.

### 2. Feature Engineering

- **Content Features:** Movie genres, keywords, cast, and crew information are processed to create feature vectors for each movie.
- **User Profiles:** User preferences are inferred by aggregating the features of movies they've previously rated highly.

### 3. Content-Based Filtering

- **Similarity Computation:** For each user, the system computes the cosine similarity between the user’s profile and all movie feature vectors.
- **Recommendation:** The system recommends movies whose content features most closely match the user's inferred preferences.

### 4. Collaborative Filtering

- **User-Item Matrix:** The ratings data is used to build a user-item matrix.
- **Matrix Factorization:** Techniques such as Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) or k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) are used to identify latent factors in user preferences and movie attributes.
- **Prediction:** The model predicts how a user might rate unseen movies and recommends those with the highest predicted ratings.

### 5. Hybrid Approach

- The system can combine both content-based and collaborative filtering results to provide more robust and diverse recommendations.

### 6. Model Evaluation

- **Metrics:** The model is evaluated using metrics like RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error), precision, recall, and hit rate on a held-out validation set.
- **Visualization:** Jupyter Notebooks are used to present evaluation results and visualize recommendation performance.

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/debashishbhagawati/Movie_Recommendation_System.git
   cd Movie_Recommendation_System
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Launch Jupyter Notebook:**
   ```bash
